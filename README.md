# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built for practice. The game allows users to play against the computer, with the classic rules of rock beating scissors, scissors beating paper, and paper beating rock. This project is a fun way to learn and demonstrate basic programming concepts like conditional logic, user input, and random number generation.
